1. Explain JRE, JDK, JVM
-> JRE: Java Runtime Environment
		JRE is a combination of JVM and set of libraries.
		JRE physically exists

   JDK: Java Development Kit
		JDK will available in the JRE
	
   JVM: Java Virtual Machine
		JVM will be taking the help of 'set of libraries' that are available in the JRE to execute the bytecode.
	    The main purpose of JVM is "Provide Runtime Environment" to execute byte code.
	    before the JVM execution it'll make some tasks,
		1. Loads the byte code
		2. Verifies the byte code
		3. Execute the byte code

2. Explain the following
	i. Class, Object, static, public, private keywords
	 -> Class: It is a design or blueprint which contains states and behaviour
			   State is represented as variable and behaviours is represented as methods.
	 -> Object: It is a instance of classes, purpose of this is to create a multiple of copy of class.
	 -> static: It is a variable which is there inside the class and outside the main
	 -> private keywords: pre-defined/reserved words are consider to be as keywords. 

	ii. public: It is access specifier or modifier
		static: Non access modifier
		void: It doesnot have any return value
		main: It is a method name
		(String []args): Parameter
	iii. System.out.println(): It is used to print an argument that is passed to it.
	
3. What is an Array
-> "It is a Collection of data which stores a group of similar type of data in a single reference(variable)".
		Syntax: Datatype [] variableName = {data};
		Ex: String superMarket[] = {"Snacks" , "Cosmetics" , "Fruits" , "Vegetables"};

4. Write a program
   Given Array: number[] = {23,45,56,67,8,12,3,5,7,9,102,34,4,5}
   i. Count the no. of prime numbers in the given array
		class Prime{
			public static void main(String a[]){
			int number[] = {23,45,56,67,8,12,3,5,7,9,102,34,4,5};
				if(n % 2 == 0){  
			System.out.println("The number is not prime");	  
			}
	  
		else{	     
			System.out.println("The number is prime");	  
			}	  
		}
		}
   
   ii. Display the even number with Count in the given array
   
   iii Display the array size
   
5. Explain the Datatypes in the java and give example for each.
-> "It represents the diffrent values stored in a vaeiable"
	There are 2 types Datatypes are there,
	i. Premitive : Anything which sores with lowecase
			   Ex: byte, short, int, long, double, char, boolean, float
	ii. Non-premitive : Anything which sores with uppercase
					Ex: String, Sysytem, className, reference type

6. What is variable, Explain its types with an examples. 
-> "Variable is a registered area allocated(datatype) in a memory"
	types of variables
	i. Local variable: Any variable Which is used inside the class and inside the main.
	ii. static variable:Any variable Which is used inside the class and outside the main.
	iii. non-static / instance: which declared the outside the class, outside the main, outside the constructor.
	iv. Parameter: 
	
7. What is constructor, when is the class constructor invoked, 
   will a class contain multiple constructors, Explain its types with an example.
   
8. Explain the java features
->i. Simple and easy: it doesn't use header, its dont have pointer and operator overloading
  ii. High performance: JVM can execute vyte code very fast.
  iii. Platform independent: Write a once run anywhere
  iv. Portable: Easily carried, it write once and run manytime / anywhere
  v. Secure: it will access restriction by access modifiers.

9. What gives java its 'write once and run anywhere' nature


10. What is the purpose of static methods and variables

11. What is the purpose of default constructor
->  default constructor will initialize the values more than once.
		  
12. Write a program to reverse a given number
	Ex: Input: 1234 output: 4321
	class Reverse{
		public static void main(String args[]) {
			int a,b;
			int d = 0;
			
			System.out.print("Enter number");
			a = 1234;
			b = a% 10;
			a = a / 10;
			d = (d*10)+ b;
			}
			System.out.println("reverse is:"+d);
			}
	}
	
	public static void main(String a[]) {
		reverse("Annakarmel Bellary\n");

13. Write a program to get the factorial of a number.
->  class Factorial{
	public static void main(String a[]){
	int num = 10;
	long factorial = 1;
	
	for(int i = 1; i <= num; i++){
		factorial * = 1;
		}
		System.out.println("Factorial of %d%d",num,factorial);
	}
	}

14. Write a program to get the sum of digits.
	Ex: Input: 234 output: 9
->	class Sum{
		public static void main(String a[]){
		int a = 234;
		int x, sum = 0;
		
		while(a > 0){
		x = a%10;
		sum = sum+x;
		n = n / 10;
		}
		System.out.println("Sum of digits:" + sum);
		}
	}
