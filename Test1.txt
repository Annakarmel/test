1. What is platform independance explain it using 100 or more words.
==> It can run on any environment / platform like windows , linux , etc.,
	The java compliled code (byte code) can run on all operating system.
  
2. What is difference between primitive and non premitive data type
==>
	-->Premitive: Anything which is stores with lowercase.
				  for ex: byte, short, int, long, double, char etc.,
	-->Non premitive: Anything which is stores with uppercase, and there are n(180000+) 
					  no.s of non premitive are there, and that are in runtime
					  for ex: String, System, className, ref type etc.,

3. explain class and its members with an example
==> "class is a design or blueprint which contains the behaviour and states.
	Where as, behaviours represents the methods and states represents the variable."
	Ex: 
	i. constructor
	ii. block 
	iii. variable-->local, ststic, instance, parameter
	iv. methods-->static, instance
	
4. Write a program to accept two inputs total marks and recived marks, 
   calculate percentage and return


5. Remove duplicates in an below array
		int[] values={34,78,90,53,34,11,53,15,78,91,8,4,67,11};
		
6. Explain the main method with a memory
==> "Collection of statements that are combined/grouped together to perform any operation / functionality".
     Syntax: access-modifier return type methodName(parameter)
	    {
		//body of the method//body of code//body of statements//					
	    }					
						
     Ex: public static  void  add(int num1 , int num2){				
		System.out.println(num1+num2);					
		}

7. Program to find reverse of a number
==> class ReverseNumber{

      public static void main(String anu[]){
	  
	  int num = 3624, rev = 0;	  
	  System.out.println("the original given number : " + num);
	  
	  while(num != 0){	  
	  int digit = num % 10;	  
	  rev = rev * 10 + digit;	  
	  num = num / 10;	  
	}
	   System.out.println("the Rev number : " + rev);	  
      }
     }

8. Program to find hours into second


9. Program to find Armstrong number
==> 
	class Armstrong {
		public static void main(String args[]){
			int number = 371,originalNumber,remainder,result = 0;
			originalNumber = number;
			while(originalNumber !=0)
			{
				remainder = originalNumber %10;
				result += Math.pow(remainder,3);
				originalNumber /=10;
			}
				if(result == number)
					System.out.println(number + " is an Armstrong number.");
				else
					System.out.println(number + " is not an Armstrong number.");
 
			}
}
